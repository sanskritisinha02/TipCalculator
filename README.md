# TipCalculator

We often go to restaurants or hotels and the service provided by the workers is just splendid, we often think about giving them a tip but don't know how much. So, here it comnes a 'Tip Calculator' which will take the total bill from the user and then it will generate 15% of it's as a tip. Isn't it helpful, try this app yourself.
